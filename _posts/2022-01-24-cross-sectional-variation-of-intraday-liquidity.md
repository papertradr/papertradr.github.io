In this post, I will be talking about the paper [Cross-Sectional Variation of Intraday Liquidity, Cross-Impact, and their effect on Portfolio Execution][1]. The paper suggests that instead of a separable execution strategies such as VWAP, it is better to execute portfolio of orders in a coupled manner due to cross-impact and intraday variation.
