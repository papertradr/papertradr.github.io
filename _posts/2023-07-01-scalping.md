There are various types of securities that we can scalp - corporate stocks/bonds, equity futures, index futures, equity options, index options and so on. 
For this tutorial, we will be looking at KOSDAQ150 Futures. KOSDAQ150 index is composed of 150 KOSDAQ-listed stocks where the constituents are selected based on the market capitalization, sector representativeness, and liquidity. KOSDAQ150 Futures contracts can be bought and sold in the Korean stock exchange; however, most brokerage firms do not allow retail investors to trade futures and options contracts before going through their training course. Only professional traders or finance savvy retail investors trade those securities and most retail investors simply trade basic stocks. To alleviate this problem, some firms have created ETFs and ETNs that are traded like stocks but track KOSDAQ150 Futures. In this post, we go over some of these securities and provide a simple scalping strategy. 


## Securities
Here we list few ETP securities that track Kosdaq150 futures (not Kosdaq150 Index): 
* *KRG530001079 (Samsung Kosdaq150 Futures 2x Inverse ETN)*
* *KRG520000578 (Mirae Kosdaq150 Futures 2x Inverse ETN)*
* *KRG570000825 (True Kosdaq150 Futures 2x Inverse ETN)*
* *KRG580000443 (Kb Kosdaq150 Futures 2x Inverse ETN)*

and we specify information about the securities using a dictionary:
```py

}
```
Whenever the futures price changes, these securities *should* technically follow the futures price movement. However, it is up to the liquidity providers and market makers to quote them. If they are too slow to follow the futures price movement, scalpers can take advantage of the price difference, which is what we will be implementing. We can summarize the relationship of all of the above ETPs and the futures contract as a graph shown below:

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/Kosdaq150_graph.png" style="width:120%;height: auto"/>
</figure>

The ETPs *depend* on the future's price movement, hence, whenever the futures price changes, we need to check the price of all EPTs. If one of the ETP price changes, we only need to check that particular ETP. Using the `Graph`, `Node`, and `Relation` classes (available in our `graphlib.py`), we can create a graph of the above securities in python:
```py
# create a graph structure
securities_graph = Graph()

# add nodes
for security_id, info in list(futures.items()) + list(etps.items()):
    securities_graph.update_node(
        Node(
            isin=security_id,
            date_str=date_str,
            name=info["name"],
            sectype=info["sectype"],
            secsubtype=info["secsubtype"],
            multiplier=info["multiplier"],
            tick_size=info["tick_size"],
            creation_unit=info["creation_unit"],
            leverage=info["leverage"],
            tz=tz,
            debug=debug
        )
    )

# add edges
for security_id, info in list(futures.items()) + list(etps.items()):
    for neighbor_id, weight in zip(info["edges_out"], info["edges_out_weight"]):
        securities_graph.update_edge(
            securities_graph.nodes[security_id],
            securities_graph.nodes[neighbor_id],
            Relation(weight)
        )
```


## Aggregating Related Securities
We first define the variables we will be using:
* $p^c_{x}(d) \text{ :  closing price of security $x$ on day $d$}$
* $p^a_{L_n, x} (d, t) \text{ : level $\ell_n$ ask price for security $x$ on day $d$, time $t$} $
* $p^b_{L_n, x} (d, t) \text{ : level $\ell_n$ bid price for security $x$ on day $d$, time $t$} $
* $\widehat{p}^a_{L_n, x, y}(d, t) \text{ : converted ask price from security $x$ to security $y$ at on day $d$, time $t$}$
* $\widehat{p}^b_{L_n, x, y}(d, t) \text{ : converted bid price from security $x$ to security $y$ on day $d$, time $t$}$
* $v^a_{L_n, x} (d, t) \text{ : level $\ell_n$ ask quantity for security $x$ on day $d$, time $t$}$
* $v^b_{L_n, x} (d, t) \text{ : level $\ell_n$ bid quantity for security $x$ on day $d$, time $t$}$
* $\widehat{v}^a_{L_n, x, y}(d, t) \text{ : converted ask quantity from security $x$ to security $y$ at on day $d$, time $t$}$
* $\widehat{v}^b_{L_n, x, y}(d, t) \text{ : converted bid quantity from security $x$ to security $y$ on day $d$, time $t$}$
* $\nu_x (d) \text{ : intrinsic value (if etp), net asset value (if etf), theoretical price, etc of secrutiy $x$}$
* $ \ell_{x} \text{ : leverage of security $x$}$
* $ m_x \text{ : multiplier of security $x$}$

The ETPs we've listed above track the current Kosdaq150 Futures contract. In order to compare those products to the futures contract they track, we need to convert the price and quantities. Below we provide the conversion equations for both price and quantity:
* $$\widehat{p}^a_{L_k, \text{etp}_m \text{fut}_n} (d,t) = \begin{cases} 
p^c_{\text{fut}_n}(d-1) \cdot \Big( 1 + 
 \big( {p_{L_k, \text{etp}_m}^a (d,t) \over \nu_{\text{etp}_m}(d-1)} - 1 \big) \big/ \ell_{\text{ept}_m} \Big), & \text{if } \ell_{etp_m} \ge 1 \\
 p^c_{\text{fut}_n}(d-1) \cdot \Big( 1 + 
 \big( {p_{L_k, \text{etp}_m}^b (d,t) \over \nu_{\text{etp}_m}(d-1)} - 1 \big) \big/ \ell_{\text{ept}_m} \Big) , & \text{if } \ell_{etp_m} \le  -1
\end{cases}$$
* $$\widehat{p}^b_{L_k, \text{etp}_m\text{fut}_n} (d,t) = \begin{cases} 
p^c_{\text{fut}_n}(d-1) \cdot \Big( 1 + 
 \big( {p_{L_k, \text{etp}_m}^b (d,t) \over \nu_{\text{etp}_m}(d-1)} - 1 \big) \big/ \ell_{\text{ept}_m} \Big), & \text{if } \ell_{etp_m} \ge 1 \\
 p^c_{\text{fut}_n}(d-1) \cdot \Big( 1 + 
 \big( {p_{L_k, \text{etp}_m}^a (d,t) \over \nu_{\text{etp}_m}(d-1)} - 1 \big) \big/ \ell_{\text{ept}_m} \Big) , & \text{if } \ell_{etp_m} \le  -1
\end{cases} $$
* $$ \widehat{v}^a_{L_k, \text{etp}_m \text{fut}_n} (d,t) = \begin{cases} 
v^a_{L_k, \text{etp}_m}(t) \cdot \Big(p^a_{L_k, \text{etp}_m} (t) \cdot \ell_{\text{etp}_m} \Big) \Big/ \Big(p^a_{L_k, \text{fut}_n}(t) \cdot m_{\text{fut}_n} \Big), & \text{ if } \ell_{\text{etp}_n} \ge 1 \\
v^b_{L_k, \text{etp}_m}(t) \cdot \Big( p^b_{L_k, \text{etp}_m} (t) \cdot \ell_{\text{etp}_m} \Big) \Big/ \Big(p^b_{L_k, \text{fut}_n}(t) \cdot m_{\text{fut}_n} \Big), & \text{ if } \ell_{\text{etp}_n} \le -1 \\
\end{cases} $$
* $$ \widehat{v}^b_{L_k, \text{etp}_m \text{fut}_n} (d,t) = \begin{cases} 
v^b_{L_k, \text{etp}_m}(t) \cdot \Big(p^b_{L_k, \text{etp}_m} (t) \cdot \ell_{\text{etp}_m} \Big) \Big/ \Big(p^b_{L_k, \text{fut}_n}(t) \cdot m_{\text{fut}_n} \Big), & \text{ if } \ell_{\text{etp}_n} \ge 1 \\
v^a_{L_k, \text{etp}_m}(t) \cdot \Big( p^a_{L_k, \text{etp}_m} (t) \cdot \ell_{\text{etp}_m} \Big) \Big/ \Big(p^a_{L_k, \text{fut}_n}(t) \cdot m_{\text{fut}_n} \Big), & \text{ if } \ell_{\text{etp}_n} \le -1 \end{cases}$$


## Aggregated Orderbook
Once we convert the price of our securities, we can put them into a single aggregated orderbook.

### Trade off in using aggregated orderbook
Creating a channel between two securities should almost always be faster than aggregating orderbook. Then why do we need an aggregated orderbook? Well let us look at couple of scenarios. We will use the same securities provided above where ETNs and ETFs price and size are normalized so that they match the price and size of KOSDAQ150 futures contract. Let's first observe the first scenario:
```bash
                        ASK                              |                      BID
1307.10:                         ["KR4106T60005":  1.00] |
1306.90:                                                 |
1306.87:                                                 | 
1306.50:                                                 |
1306.21:                         ["KRG530001079":  0.10] |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1306.60:                                                 |  ["KR4106T60005": 3.0]
1306.50:                                                 |  ["KR4106T60005": 3.0]
```
Here we are tracking two securities: KOSDAQ150 futures and Samsung Ivnerse 2x KOSDAQ150 Futures ETN. The best ask price of the futures contract is greater than that of ETN, which is a possible trading opportunity. Given our assumption that futures price moves first, we can short the futures contract and go long on ETN. However, because the ETN quantity is less than 1, we are not able to create a position. Now let us look at a different scenario where we track all securities using an aggregated orderbook:
```bash
                        ASK                              |                      BID
1307.10:                         ["KR4106T60005":  1.00] |
1306.90:                         ["KRG570000825":  0.15] |
1306.87:                         ["KRG530001079":  5.62] | 
1306.50: ["KR7250780004": 1.59], ["KR7251340006": 94.84] |
1306.21:                         ["KRG530001079":  0.10] |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1306.60:                                                 |  ["KR4106T60005": 3.0]
1306.50:                                                 |  ["KR4106T60005": 3.0]
```
In this above scenario, we see that securities prefixed with 'KRG'(ETNs) and 'KR7'(ETFs) are cheaper than KOSDAQ150 future's best ask price. Similarly, given our assumption that futures contract moves first, we can short the futures contract and go long on one of the ETNs or ETFs. As opposed to the earlier example, here we can pick any one of the securities priced lower than the future's best ask price. Furthermore, we can combine different securities to maximize our gain. In the above case, we can purchase 0.1 worth of `KRG530001079` and 0.9 worth of `KR7250780004`. This would yield the maximum profit in the above state. 

This is only one of many ways we can use an aggregated orderbook. In general, the aggregated orderbook allows traders to come up with variety of strategies. However, there is a trade off. If only one security has the most volume, then it is probably best to track two securities instead. Hence, it is essential that we understand the market characteristics before designing our data structure.



## Creating upper and lower channel
Given an aggregated orderbook, we want to create upper and lower channels. Since all ETPs track the futures price, we need to find the difference between the futures price and the ETPs. Notice that while there is only one futures contract, there are multiple ETPs, so we need to pick the appropriate ETP for channel creation. Since we have already converted all ETPs into equivalent futures price, we can pick the ETP with the best ask and bid price. Furthermore, after the conversion, the quantity of ETPs can have decimal values (e.g. quantity could be 0.8). We need to match the quantity of the futures contract with that of ETPs. The solution is to go up the orderbook and find the next best ask or bid price, then average the prices to get the average best offer and best bid of the ETPs. 

We define the upper and lower channel as:

$$\mathcal{U}(d, t) = p^a_{L_1,\text{fut}}(d, t) - p^b_{L_1, \text{etp}_\text{agg}, \text{fut}}$$

$$\mathcal{L}(d, t) = p^b_{L_1, \text{fut}} - p^a_{L_1, \text{etp}_\text{agg}, \text{fut}}$$

where

$$p^a_{L_1, \text{etp}_\text{agg}, \text{fut}} =  \sum_{k=1}^5 \Bigg( p^a_{L_k, \text{etp}}  \cdot  { \min \Big( \max \Big(0, 1- \sum_{j=1}^{k-1} \sum_m v^a_{L_j, \text{etp}_m} \Big), \sum_m v^a_{L_k, \text{etp}_m} \Big) } \Bigg) $$

$$p^b_{L_1, \text{etp}_\text{agg}, \text{fut}} =  \sum_{k=1}^5  \Bigg( p^b_{L_k, \text{etp}} \cdot { \min \Big( \max \Big(0, 1- \sum_{j=1}^{k-1} \sum_m v^b_{L_j, \text{etp}_m} \Big), \sum_m v^b_{L_k, \text{etp}_m} \Big) } \Bigg) $$

which are best ask and bid prices in our aggregated ETP book. Using historical tick data, we compute the upper and lower channels between KOSDAQ150 futures and aggregated ETPs:

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/kosdaq150_scalping_channels.png" style="width:120%;height: auto"/>
</figure>

The above intraday upper and lower channels provide us with entry and exit signals. When the upper channel goes below 0, it implies that either the futures price went down or the ETP price went up. However, recall that our ETPs track the futures price and not vice versa. So it is unlikely (but possible) that our ETP price went up independently, so we can with high probability assume that the futures price came down. Similarly, when the price of our lower channel is above 0, it indicates that the futures price went up. Let us get a closer look at some of these occurrences.

### Example 1
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/channel_1.png" style="width:120%;height: auto"/>
</figure>
Let us look at the orderbook before, during and after the huge dip around `09:02:55`:

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/channel_1_1.png" style="width:120%;height: auto"/>
</figure>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/channel_1_2.png" style="width:120%;height: auto"/>
</figure>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/channel_1_3.png" style="width:120%;height: auto"/>
</figure>
`KRG52000578` with size 1.58 appears out of nowhere and creates the huge dip in our upper channel. Later, it gets either gets cancelled or executed and our channel goes back to its equilibrium state. 



### Example 2
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/channel_4.png" style="width:120%;height: auto"/>
</figure>
Here we see an extended period where the lower channel goes over the upper channel. Aggregated orderbook snapshots are in order:
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/channel_4_1.png" style="width:120%;height: auto"/>
</figure>
The orderbook is at its equilibrium state.
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/channel_4_2.png" style="width:120%;height: auto"/>
</figure>
Here we see a 'crossing' order where the futures best bid price makes a jump from `1290.7` to `1291.1`. Notice that the quantity at the new best bid price is 24 which is a significant amount. 
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/channel_4_5.png" style="width:120%;height: auto"/>
</figure>
We other futures orders filling the gap between the best bid and the next best bid price (i.e. `1290.8`, `1290.9`, `1291.0`).
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/channel_4_7.png" style="width:120%;height: auto"/>
</figure>
We see futures prices climbing up even more, and the best bid price is at `1291.9`. However, the best offer for ETPs are lagging behind at `1290.4`. This is a prime example where the futures price moves before ETPs catch up. The most obvious way to take advantage in this situation is to go long on ETPs and short the futures. Here we see one futures contract at `1292.0`. To match this amount, we can pick up 0.31 worth of `KRG530001079` at `1290.4`, 0.38 worth of `KRG530001079` at `1290.7` and 0.31 worth of `KRG52000578` at `1290.8`. The average price of our long position is about `1290.638`.
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/channel_4_10.png" style="width:120%;height: auto"/>
</figure>
After 30 seconds, the best bid price of the futures contract settles at `1293.2`. If we made our aforementioned position, then we'd be buying futures at `1293.4`, resulting in a loss of 1.4 points. For ETPs, we'd have $0.31 \cdot (1293.2 - 1290.4) + 0.38 \cdot (1293.2 - 1290.7) + 0.31 \cdot (1293.3 - 1290.8) = 2.593$ gain. Combining the two and applying the multiplier, we get 11930 won profit per contract before fee. 


### Example 3
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/channel_5.png" style="width:120%;height: auto"/>
</figure>
In contrast to the previous example, here we see the upper channel going below our lower channel, implying that futures price came down. 
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/channel_5_1.png" style="width:120%;height: auto"/>
</figure>
The orderbook is at equilibrium state.
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/channel_5_2.png" style="width:120%;height: auto"/>
</figure>
We see a `KRG580000443` placing aggressive bid positions and the futures price is going down. Here we long futures contract and short ETPs. Let's assume that we long 7 futures at `1282.7` and short `KRG580000443` at `1283.9`.
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/channel_5_3.png" style="width:120%;height: auto"/>
</figure>
After 15 seconds, we are back to an equilibrium state. Exiting our position yields $7 \cdot (1283.9 - 1283.6) = 2.1$ and $7 \cdot (1283.0 - 1282.7) = 2.1$, which yields $42000$ won profit.
